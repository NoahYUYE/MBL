## 1. 数字化管理基础薄弱 / Weak Digital Management Foundation

### 现状描述 / Current Situation Description

MBL客户目前的Hauling业务运营几乎完全依靠人工管理，缺乏基础的数字化系统支撑。关键业务指标如能源消耗、运送量等均通过人工记账方式统计，不仅效率低下，且容易出错。随着业务从外包模式转变为自营管理模式，缺乏成熟的自主管理数字工具已成为阻碍业务高效运营的关键因素。

The MBL client's current Hauling business operations rely almost entirely on manual management, lacking basic digital system support. Key business metrics such as energy consumption and transport volume are recorded through manual bookkeeping, which is not only inefficient but also prone to errors. As the business transitions from an outsourced model to a self-operated management model, the lack of mature self-management digital tools has become a key factor hindering efficient business operations.
