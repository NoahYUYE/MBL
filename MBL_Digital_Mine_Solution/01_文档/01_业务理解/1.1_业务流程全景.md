## 1. Hauling作业流程概述 / Overview of Hauling Operations Process
- 本节旨在对MBL客户露天煤矿的煤炭运输作业流程进行梳理，专注于**从堆场到港口的煤炭运输**全流程，包括任务规划、堆场装载、公路运输、港口卸载及驳船装载等环节。目标是清晰地盘点出每个环节的关键活动、需要接入或集成的关联子系统、涉及的核心设备类型（明确哪些设备需要接入物联网进行数据采集），以及用于管理和优化的关键绩效指标（KPI），为后续MBL客户的管控塔功能设计和集成方案奠定基础。
- This section aims to outline the coal transportation process for the MBL client's open-pit coal mine, focusing on the **complete process of coal transportation from stockpile to port**, including task planning, stockpile loading, road transportation, port unloading, and barge loading stages. The objective is to clearly inventory the key activities at each stage, the associated subsystems requiring connection or integration, the core equipment types involved (identifying which equipment needs IoT connectivity for data acquisition), and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for management and optimization. This will lay the foundation for the subsequent design of the Control Tower's functions and integration plan for the MBL client.

### 1.0 Hauling任务触发与规划 / Hauling Task Triggering & Planning
- **流程简述 / Process Brief:**
  - 中文：对于MBL客户的煤炭运输业务，本方案关注的Hauling流程主要始于**煤炭销售订单的确认**。收到销售订单后，相关部门（如销售、物流或计划部门）将制定详细的**发运计划 (Dispatch/Shipment Plan)**。该计划会明确煤炭的种类、数量、质量要求、客户、目标港口/目的地、期望交付时间等。基于发运计划，调度中心或相关职能部门将进行运输资源的具体安排，包括分配合适的卡车（考虑三一电动重卡和燃油卡车的特性及成本）、指派司机、预定驳船（如适用）、规划运输路线（考虑换电站、加油点、路况、港口称重等），并下达具体的运输任务指令。
  - English: For the MBL client's coal transportation business, the Hauling process focused on in this solution primarily begins with the **confirmation of a coal Sales Order**. Upon receiving a sales order, the relevant department (e.g., Sales, Logistics, or Planning) will develop a detailed **Dispatch/Shipment Plan**. This plan specifies the coal type, quantity, quality requirements, customer, target port/destination, and desired delivery timeline. Based on the dispatch plan, the dispatch center or responsible function will then make specific transportation resource arrangements, including allocating suitable trucks (considering the characteristics and costs of SANY electric heavy trucks and diesel trucks), assigning drivers, booking barges (if applicable), planning transport routes (considering battery swapping stations, refueling points, road conditions, port weighbridges), and issuing specific transport task instructions.

### 1.1 装载环节 / Loading Stage
- **流程简述 / Process Brief:**
  - 中文：对于MBL客户，**从堆场将煤炭装载到重卡**的过程主要通过**堆场输送带装载系统**完成，例如通过斗轮机或给料机将煤炭给到输送带，再通过装车楼/快速装车站装入卡车。**装载完成后，卡车将驶过矿区出口处的称重桥 (Weighbridge)，进行第一次官方重量记录，然后根据FMS指令驶向港口。**
  - English: For the MBL client, loading coal **from stockpiles onto heavy trucks** is primarily accomplished via **stockpile conveyor loading systems**, e.g., using reclaimers or feeders to move coal to a conveyor, which then loads trucks via a loading bin/rapid load-out station. **After loading is complete, the truck will pass over a weighbridge at the mine exit for the first official weight recording, then proceed to the port as per FMS instructions.**

### 1.2 运输环节 / Transportation Stage
- **流程简述 / Process Brief:**
  - 中文：已装载煤炭的矿用卡车（包括三一电动重卡和其他品牌燃油卡车），按照调度指令或预设优化路线，从矿山堆场行驶至港口，对于电动卡车还需考虑往返换电站的路径规划。运输过程中需关注道路状况、交通安全和运行效率。
  - English: Loaded haul trucks (including SANY electric heavy trucks and other brands of diesel trucks), carrying coal, travel from the mine stockyard to the port, following dispatch instructions or pre-set optimized routes. For electric trucks, path planning to and from battery swapping stations must also be considered. Road conditions, traffic safety, and operational efficiency are key concerns during transport.

### 1.3 卸载环节 / Dumping Stage
- **流程简述 / Process Brief:**
  - 中文：对于MBL客户运往港口的煤炭，卡车在到达港区后，**首先会通过港区称重桥 (Port Weighbridge) 进行第二次官方重量记录**，然后行驶至指定的卸料点（如卡车卸料斗）卸载煤炭，煤炭随后通过**港口输送带装船系统（如装船机）**装载到驳船上。港口驳船装载作业尤其强调对驳船作业的全程监控，包括驳船何时开始装载、何时离开码头（如RJT）、何时抵达锚地、何时完成卸载以及何时返航，这些均是重要的成本和效率监控点。
  - English: For coal transported to the port for the MBL client, upon arrival at the port area, **trucks will first pass over a port weighbridge for a second official weight recording**. They then proceed to a designated unloading point (e.g., truck dump hopper) to discharge the coal, which is subsequently loaded onto barges via **port conveyor ship loading systems (e.g., ship loaders)**. Port barge loading operations particularly emphasize comprehensive monitoring of the entire barge cycle, including when barges start loading, depart from the jetty (e.g., RJT), reach the anchorage point, complete unloading, and their return trip timing, all of which are critical cost and efficiency monitoring points.

### 1.4 空返与等待 / Empty Return & Queuing
- **流程简述 / Process Brief:**
  - 中文：完成卸载的矿用卡车空车返回矿山堆场，准备下一轮的装载作业。途中可能涉及等待调度指令、在特定区域（如加油站）排队或前往换电站进行电池更换。
  - English: After unloading at the port, empty haul trucks return to the mine stockyard to prepare for the next loading operation. This may involve waiting for dispatch instructions, queuing in specific areas (e.g., at fuel stations), or visiting battery swapping stations for battery replacement.

### 1.5 辅助流程（如加油、交接班、设备检查、维修维保） / Ancillary Processes (e.g., Refueling, Shift Handover, Equipment Inspection, Maintenance)
- **流程简述 / Process Brief:**
  - 中文：支持Hauling主流程顺畅运行的必要辅助活动。对于露天煤矿，包括：燃油卡车的计划内/外加油及油品采购、存储、加注全过程监管；三一电动重卡的电池更换作业（在沿运输路线分布的各三一换电站进行），**每个换电站均由其配备的独立三一柴油发电机专门供电 (solely powered by its dedicated SANY diesel generator)**，不对外部电网依赖。换电站的自身运营包括其电池库存管理（充电、维护）、发电机运行维护及燃料保障；司机及辅助人员交接班；严格的出车前后安全检查；轮胎管理；设备故障快速响应与现场抢修；计划性预防性维护保养等。
  - English: Necessary support activities for the smooth operation of the main Hauling process in an open-pit coal mine. This includes: for diesel trucks, scheduled/unscheduled refueling and comprehensive oversight of fuel procurement, storage, and dispensing; for SANY electric heavy trucks, battery swapping operations (at SANY battery swapping stations distributed along transport routes), with **each swapping station exclusively powered by its own dedicated SANY diesel generator**, with no reliance on the external grid. The swapping station's own operations include its battery inventory management (charging, maintenance), generator operation and maintenance, and fuel supply assurance; shift handovers for drivers and support personnel; rigorous pre/post-trip safety inspections; tire management; rapid response to equipment breakdowns and field repairs; and planned preventive maintenance.
